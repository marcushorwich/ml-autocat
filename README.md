# AutoCat: Automated Product Categorization

The goal of this project is to explore relationships between product statistics and categories for a customer using category management software.  From a product perspective, it will be useful to develop a tool for store owners that would reduce the time consuming task of hard-coding categorization rules on a product-by-product basis for thousands of products.  Labelled data from existing store owners that are part of a data pool provides an opportunity to develop a machine learning model that is capable of automatically categorizing a set of existing products and labelling new products as they arrive in real time through electronic invoices.

The performance of hard-coded rules on the product categorization task has not been quantified but we assume there is at least some level of error due to the monotonous nature of applying labels to 10,000+ products and the cognitive toll it takes.  We believe that the product categorization task as applied to historical products and products arriving in real time could benefit from the application of machine learning.  

With a more efficient, less time-consuming onboarding process for users of category management software, businesses have the opportunity to create a more appealing product.
